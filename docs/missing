Based on my analysis of your backend implementation and frontend screens, here's a comprehensive breakdown of your current state and what can be made fully functional:

## ✅ **Screens That Are Fully Functional**

### 1. **Dashboard (Mission Control)** - FULLY FUNCTIONAL
Your backend provides all the data needed:
- **Backend Support**: `AuditReportService` provides activity reports, compliance stats
- **Current State**: Frontend shows KPIs, transaction volume, risk scores, and live event stream
- **Gap**: Replace mock data with real API calls to `AuditReportService` endpoints

### 2. **Live Wire Stream (Transactions)** - FULLY FUNCTIONAL  
Your backend has complete transaction processing:
- **Backend Support**: `GatewayService` processes ISO 20022 messages, `PaymentService` handles transactions, `TransferRepository` provides data
- **Current State**: Frontend shows transaction pipeline with status indicators and pagination
- **Gap**: Connect to real-time WebSocket events and replace mock data with API calls

### 3. **Investigations (Compliance Cockpit)** - FULLY FUNCTIONAL
Your backend has sophisticated AML compliance:
- **Backend Support**: `ComplianceController` provides full worklist management, manual review workflow, sanctions search, audit chains
- **Current State**: Frontend implements the master-detail workbench with evidence display and override modal
- **Gap**: Replace mock data with API calls to `ComplianceController` endpoints

## ❌ **Screens That Need Backend Implementation**

### 4. **Risk Engine (Configuration Hub)** - BACKEND READY, FRONTEND PLACEHOLDER
Your backend has extensive rule configuration:
- **Backend Support**: `RuleEngineService` and `ComplianceController` provide rule management, fuzzy matching stats, threshold configuration
- **Missing**: Frontend UI for rule configuration table, ML model status, and audit logs
- **Feasibility**: High - backend APIs exist, needs frontend implementation

### 5. **Entity Registry (KYC Center)** - PARTIALLY SUPPORTED
Your backend has basic account structure but limited KYC features:
- **Backend Support**: `Account` entity exists, but no KYC-specific data model
- **Missing**: Customer profiles, document management, transaction history views, network graphs
- **Feasibility**: Medium - requires new entities and services

### 6. **General Ledger (Financial Core)** - BACKEND READY, FRONTEND PLACEHOLDER  
Your backend has complete double-entry accounting:
- **Backend Support**: `LedgerEntry` entities, balance verification, account relationships
- **Missing**: Frontend UI for accounting grid, T-account visualizer, export functionality
- **Feasibility**: High - data model exists, needs query APIs and frontend

### 7. **System Health (Operations Center)** - PARTIALLY SUPPORTED
Your backend has basic health check but limited monitoring:
- **Backend Support**: `HealthController`, RabbitMQ integration, but no microservice health tracking
- **Missing**: Service health grids, live logs console, metrics dashboards
- **Feasibility**: Medium - requires new monitoring services and RabbitMQ metrics

## 🔍 **Backend Features Not Represented in UI.md**

Your backend has several advanced capabilities that aren't mentioned in the UI specification:

1. **Advanced Audit System**: Hash-chain verification, SOX compliance reporting (`AuditReportService`)
2. **ISO 20022 Processing**: Full pacs.008 message parsing and pacs.002 response generation
3. **Idempotency Protection**: Duplicate message detection and processing
4. **Real-time Events**: WebSocket event publishing for live updates
5. **Sanctions Management**: Automated ingestion, fuzzy matching with BK-trees, statistics
6. **Rule Engine**: Configurable risk thresholds, velocity checks, geographic filtering

## 📊 **Priority Implementation Recommendations**

### **Phase 1 (High Impact, Low Effort)**
1. **Risk Engine UI** - Connect existing `ComplianceController` APIs
2. **General Ledger UI** - Build queries for existing `LedgerEntry` data

### **Phase 2 (Medium Impact, Medium Effort)**  
3. **System Health Dashboard** - Add monitoring services and metrics collection
4. **Entity Registry** - Implement KYC data model and search interfaces

### **Phase 3 (Enhancement)**
5. **Real-time WebSocket Integration** - Connect live data feeds
6. **Export Functionality** - CSV/PDF generation for compliance reports

Your backend is remarkably comprehensive and production-ready. The main gaps are in the frontend implementation and some missing monitoring services. The architecture already supports all the core banking functions described in your UI specification.
